# Atmospheric scattering explained

My attempt at explaining how the colors of the sky come to be, and how it's implemented.

The full explanation, and up to date version can be found in [atmosphere.glsl](atmosphere.glsl), 
as well as [on shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wlBXWK)

any other experiments I do and ideas I have to improve it can be found under [notes](notes)
